**Observational learning is the process of learning by watching the behaviors of others.**  The targeted behavior is watched, memorized, and then mimicked.

You can employ the same strategy in video games by observing players with higher skill, enabling you to mimic and adopt their techniques.

I use this technique while watching ALG's VODs to replicate the plays, team fights, and rings. I enjoy watching TSM because I'm learning to be an in-game leader (IGL) in high-pressure situations.

I've progressed from crumbling under pressure during fights to confidently making calls, guiding my team to take space, and telling them to retreat when necessary.

I've used this technique in the past without knowing it by watching others bowl and replicating what they do I went from constant low scores and spares to striking out almost every single time, around 12-15 years old.

“There are four processes that researchers have identified as influencing observational learning: attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation” (Debell, 2021)

# Attention


To learn, people need to watch their surroundings, and how much they pay attention can change depending on who they're learning from and where they are learning from.

When it comes to observational learning, there are various factors that influence the extent to which individuals pay attention to the behaviors of others. One of these factors is the degree of similarity between the model and the observer. People are more likely to pay attention to individuals who they perceive as similar to themselves in some way. This could be in terms of status, talent, intelligence, or any other characteristic that the observer finds relatable.

Additionally, the observer's current mood can also affect their level of attention. If someone is in a positive mood or feeling motivated, they may be more inclined to focus and pay closer attention to the actions of others. On the other hand, if someone is in a negative mood or feeling distracted, their attention may be diminished.

Bandura (1985) proposed these ideas, highlighting the significance of these variables in the process of observational learning. By understanding how these factors come into play, we can gain insights into why certain models or behaviors may capture our attention more than others.

For example Apprenticeships: Apprenticeships are a perfect example of observational learning. Through an apprenticeship, you can observe and learn from professionals in action, as opposed to traditional classroom learning.

# Retention 

Attention alone is not sufficient to learn a new behavior. Observers must also retain, or remember, the behavior for later. To enhance retention, observers can organize the information in a manner that is easy to remember.

“This could involve using a mnemonic device or a daily learning habit, such as spaced repetition. In the end, however, the behavior must be easily remembered so that the action can later be performed by the learner with little to no effort” (Debel, 2021)

# Motor Reproduction

Once you've remembered or stored information about a behavior, the next step is being able to actually do it in the real world or in a game. This often means that you might need to practice the new behavior for many hours to get the skills and abilities required to perform it successfully.

“Thus, the process of reproduction is one that can potentially take years to craft and perfect.”(Debell, 2021)


# Motivation

Finally, all learning requires, to some extent, personal motivation. Thus, in observational learning, an observer must be motivated to produce the desired behavior.

This motivation can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to the observer. In the latter case, motivation comes in the form of rewards

“For example, the extrinsic motivation of someone seeking to climb the corporate ladder could include the incentive of earning a high salary and more autonomy at work” (Debell, 2021)
