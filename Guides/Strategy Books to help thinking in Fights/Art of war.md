# Now? What does this mean.


Just like I talked about in Observational Learning The act of Observational Learning isn't just for watching someone do something, you can also adopt tactics and skills from reading.

I've been reading The Art of War recently, because come on if it can help Technoblade in Minecraft PvP and the Potato War then it can be applied to fps shooters, like Apex.

The Art of War isn't the only military tactic book you can read to improve, but it is the only one I have touched, I have some that I'm going to look into to see.

I've been focusing on the important passages from the book, and Key lessons in this I'm going to write down a quote and break it down to the best of my ability

**A quick summary of the book before we dive in**:

Know when to fight and when not to fight: avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak. Know how to deceive the enemy: appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. Know your strengths and weaknesses: if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

# Quotes and Paragraph Breakdown

***"Then, to the sound of the drums he gave the order 'Right turn.' but the girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzu said: "If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame."***

1. **Clarity in Commands**: in Apex, Clear and precise comms are crucial for good teamwork. In a game like Apex, if a teams comms are unclear it can lead to confusion and failure. For instance if someone calls to “Move Right” but doesn't specify the exact direction or the context (towards cover, or away from enemy) teammates might not follow the instruction correctly, leading to getting caught out and losing.
2. **Understanding Orders**: The effectiveness of a command depends not just on how its delivered but also on how well its understood. In Apex, this means that teammates need to be on the page. If one player doesn't understand the comm given it can lead to mishaps. For example if the IGL calls to “Hold Here” but doesn't know where “here” is or a certain part of the building they need to be, it can lead to bad positioning.
3. **Responsibility of Leadership**: It's the responsibility of the leader to ensure that their commands are clear and understood. In Comp Apex, this is often the team Coach or IGL's job to come up with Strats, rotations, and engagement plans. This means leaders need to be clear, concise, and check for understanding to make sure everyone on the team knows their role and plan.
4. **Team Dynamics**: Just as the general in the quote is to blame for unclear orders, in Apex, the team's success or failure can regularly reflect the effectiveness of its comms structure. If the team frequently finds itself in chaos, it may be a sign of poor communication or leadership. Regular Practice, clear strats, and effective communication are key to preventing misunderstandings and making sure every member of the team is aligned and read to execute the plan.

***“Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.”***

Knowing your team's strengths and weaknesses is important, know your characters abilities, the teams overall strategy, and how well each member preforms each fight.
Equally significant is knowing the enemies,  recognize their play styles, common strats, and the strengths and weaknesses of each legend. This knowledge can guide a team to know when to fight, and know when to back off.

***All warfare is based on deception.”*** 

Deception plays a big role in comp play. For example, you may fake a retreat to lure enemies to push on your own playing field (e.g. placing bait zips, and bait evacs), or use bang smoke to reposition. Effective use of misdirection can catch teams off guard and can make a whole team fight go your way.

***“The skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.”***

Positioning is fundamental. High ground provides a tactical advantage and better visibility. Knowing how to take cover, terrain, and choke points to use to your advantage can be the difference between winning and losing. Effective positioning also requires knowing when to be aggro and when to hold back.

***
***“Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness.”***

The game's dynamic environment, and fast-paced nature requires teams to adjust their strats constantly. Whether it's changing your approach mid-fight, or adapting to new enemy tactics. Being able to pivot effectively is important. Flexibility in roles and strats, such as changing team comp based on the map, can be helpful.

***
***“The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought.”***

Good Leadership and Team cohesion is critical. Leaders need to make strategic decisions based on in-game information, such as enemy locations, the ring's location, and resources. Clear comms and team unity help immensely. A leader must also anticipate enemy actions and plan accordingly.

***
***"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."***

Understanding your team's strengths and weaknesses, as well those of your opponents, is critical. This includes knowing each player's preferred legends, play style, and capabilities. Awareness of enemy comp's and tactics can allow you to adapt and counter effectively.

***
***"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.”***

Capitalize on your enemies' mistakes or moments of defenselessness. If you notice an enemy squad is low on health or shields after a fight, engage them before they can recover. Legends with abilities that can disrupt enemies, like Bang ult, Crypto EMP, Seer Scan/ult, and Bloodhound scans, to reveal and exploit their weaknesses.
